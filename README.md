This is an industrial-strength monadic parser combinator library. Megaparsec
is a fork of [Parsec](https://github.com/haskell/parsec) library originally
written by Daan Leijen.

## Features

This project provides flexible solutions to satisfy common parsing needs.
The section describes them shortly. If you're looking for comprehensive
documentation, see the [section about documentation](#documentation).

### Core features

The package is built around `MonadParsec`, an MTL-style monad transformer.
All tools and features work with all instances of `MonadParsec`. You can
achieve various effects combining monad transformers, i.e. building monad
stack. Since the standard common monad transformers like `WriterT`,
`StateT`, `ReaderT` and others are instances of the `MonadParsec` type
class, you can wrap `ParsecT` *in* these monads, achieving, for example,
backtracking state.

On the other hand `ParsecT` is an instance of many type classes as well. The
most useful ones are `Monad`, `Applicative`, `Alternative`, and
`MonadParsec`.

Megaparsec includes all functionality that is available in Parsec plus
features some combinators that are missing in other parsing libraries:

* `failure` allows to fail reporting a parse error with unexpected and
  expected items.

* `fancyFailure` allows to fail reporting custom error messages.

* `withRecovery` allows to recover from parse errors “on-the-fly” and
  continue parsing. Once parsing is finished, several parse errors may be
  reported or ignored altogether.

* `observing` allows to “observe” parse errors without ending parsing (they
  are returned in `Left`, while normal results are wrapped in `Right`).

In addition to that, Megaparsec 6 features high-performance combinators
similar to those found in Attoparsec:

* `tokens` makes it easy to parse several tokens in a row (`string` and
  `string'` are built on top of this primitive). This is about 100 times
  faster than matching a string token by token. `tokens` returns “chunk” of
  original input, meaning that if you parse `Text`, it'll return `Text`
  without any repacking.

* `takeWhile` and `takeWhile1` are about 150 times faster than approaches
  involving `many`, `manyTill` and other similar combinators.

* `takeP` allows to grab n tokens from the stream and returns them as a
  “chunk” of the stream.

So now that we have matched the main “performance boosters” of Attoparsec,
Megaparsec 6 is not significantly slower than Attoparsec if you write your
parser carefully.

Megaparsec can currently work with the following types of input stream
out-of-the-box:

* `String` = `[Char]`
* `ByteString` (strict and lazy)
* `Text` (strict and lazy)

It's also simple to make it work with custom token streams, and Megaparsec
users have done so many times with great success.

### Error messages

Megaparsec 5 introduces well-typed error messages and the ability to use
custom data types to adjust the library to specific domain of interest. No
need to use a shapeless bunch of strings anymore.

The design of parse errors has been revised in version 6 significantly, but
custom errors are still easy (probably even easier now).

### Alex and Happy support

Megaparsec works well with streams of tokens produced by tools like
Alex/Happy. The design of the `Stream` type class has been changed
significantly in version 6, but user can still work with custom streams of
tokens without problems.

### Character parsing

Megaparsec has decent support for Unicode-aware character parsing. Functions
for character parsing live in the
[`Text.Megaparsec.Char`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec/docs/Text-Megaparsec-Char.html) module.
The functions can be divided into several categories:

* *Simple parsers*—parsers that parse certain character or several
  characters of the same kind. This includes `newline`, `crlf`, `eol`,
  `tab`, and `space`.

* *Parsers corresponding to categories of characters* parse single character
  that belongs to certain category of characters, for example:
  `controlChar`, `spaceChar`, `upperChar`, `lowerChar`, `printChar`,
  `digitChar`, and others.

* *General parsers* that allow you to parse a single character you specify
  or one of the given characters, or any character except for the given
  ones, or character satisfying given predicate. Case-insensitive versions
  of the parsers are available.

* *Parsers for sequences of characters* parse strings. Case-sensitive
  `string` parser is available as well as case-insensitive `string'`.

### Binary parsing

Similarly, there is
[`Text.Megaparsec.Byte`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec/docs/Text-Megaparsec-Byte.html) module
for parsing streams of bytes.

### Permutation parsing

For those who are interested in parsing of permutation phrases, there
is [`Text.Megaparsec.Perm`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec/docs/Text-Megaparsec-Perm.html).
You have to import the module explicitly, it's not included in the
`Text.Megaparsec` module.

### Expression parsing

Megaparsec has a solution for parsing of expressions. Take a look at
[`Text.Megaparsec.Expr`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec/docs/Text-Megaparsec-Expr.html). You have to import the module explicitly, it's not
included in the `Text.Megaparsec`.

Given a table of operators that describes their fixity and precedence, you
can construct a parser that will parse any expression involving the
operators. See documentation for comprehensive description of how it works.

### Lexer

[`Text.Megaparsec.Char.Lexer`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec/docs/Text-Megaparsec-Char-Lexer.html)
is a module that should help you write your lexer. If you have used `Parsec`
in the past, this module “fixes” its particularly inflexible
`Text.Parsec.Token`.

`Text.Megaparsec.Char.Lexer` is intended to be imported via a qualified
import, it's not included in `Text.Megaparsec`. The module doesn't impose
how you should write your parser, but certain approaches may be more elegant
than others. An especially important theme is parsing of white space,
comments, and indentation.

The design of the module allows you quickly solve simple tasks and doesn't
get in your way when you want to implement something less standard.

Since Megaparsec 5, all tools for indentation-sensitive parsing are
available in `Text.Megaparsec.Char.Lexer` module—no third party packages
required.

`Text.Megaparsec.Byte.Lexer` is also available for users who wish to parse
binary data.

## Documentation

Megaparsec is well-documented. All functions and data-types are thoroughly
described. We pay attention to avoid outdated info or unclear phrases in our
documentation. See the [current version of Megaparsec documentation on
Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec) for yourself.

## Tutorials

You can find Megaparsec
tutorials
[here](https://markkarpov.com/learn-haskell.html#megaparsec-tutorials). They
should provide sufficient guidance to help you to start with your parsing
tasks. The site also has instructions and tips for Parsec users who decide
to migrate to Megaparsec.

## Performance

Despite being quite flexible, Megaparsec is also faster than Parsec. The
repository includes benchmarks that can be easily used to compare Megaparsec
and Parsec. In most cases Megaparsec is faster, sometimes dramatically
faster. If you happen to have some other benchmarks, I would appreciate if
you add Megaparsec to them and let me know how it performs.

Additional benchmarks created to guide development of Megaparsec 6 can be
found [here](https://github.com/mrkkrp/parsers-bench). These compare 3 pairs
of parsers written using Attoparsec and Megaparsec.

If you think your Megaparsec parser is not efficient enough, take a look
at [these instructions](https://markkarpov.com/megaparsec/writing-a-fast-parser.html).

## Comparison with other solutions

There are quite a few libraries that can be used for parsing in Haskell,
let's compare Megaparsec with some of them.

### Megaparsec vs Attoparsec

[Attoparsec](https://github.com/bos/attoparsec) is another prominent Haskell
library for parsing. Although the both libraries deal with parsing, it's
usually easy to decide which you will need in particular project:

* *Attoparsec* is much faster but not that feature-rich. It should be used
  when you want to process large amounts of data where performance matters
  more than quality of error messages.

* *Megaparsec* is good for parsing of source code or other human-readable
  texts. It has better error messages and it's implemented as monad
  transformer.

So, if you work with something human-readable where size of input data is
usually not huge, just go with Megaparsec, otherwise Attoparsec may be a
better choice.

Since version 6, Megaparsec features the same fast primitives that
Attoparsec has, so in many cases the difference in speed is not that big.
Megaparsec now aims to be “one size fits all” ultimate solution to parsing,
so it can be used even to parse low-level binary formats.

### Megaparsec vs Parsec

Since Megaparsec is a fork of Parsec, we are bound to list the main
differences between the two libraries:

* Better error messages. We test our error messages using dense QuickCheck
  tests. Good error messages are just as important for us as correct return
  values of our parsers. Megaparsec will be especially useful if you write a
  compiler or an interpreter for some language.

* Megaparsec 6 can show line on which parse error happened as part of parse
  error. This makes it a lot easier to figure out where the error happened.

* Some quirks and “buggy features” (as well as plain bugs) of original
  Parsec are fixed. There is no undocumented surprising stuff in Megaparsec.

* Better support for Unicode parsing in `Text.Megaparsec.Char`.

* Megaparsec has more powerful combinators and can parse languages where
  indentation matters.

* Comprehensive QuickCheck test suite covering nearly 100% of our code.

* We have benchmarks to detect performance regressions.

* Better documentation, with 100% of functions covered, without typos and
  obsolete information, with working examples. Megaparsec's documentation is
  well-structured and doesn't contain things useless to end users.

* Megaparsec's code is clearer and doesn't contain “magic” found in original
  Parsec.

* Megaparsec has well-typed error messages and custom error messages.

* Megaparsec can recover from parse errors “on the fly” and continue
  parsing.

* Megaparsec allows to conditionally process parse errors *inside your
  parser* before parsing is finished. In particular, it's possible to define
  regions in which parse errors, should they happen, will get a “context
  tag”, e.g. we could build a context stack like “in function definition
  foo”, “in expression x”, etc. This is not possible with Parsec.

* Megaparsec is faster and supports efficient operations on top of `tokens`,
  `takeWhileP`, `takeWhile1P`, `takeP` just like Attoparsec.

If you want to see a detailed change log, `CHANGELOG.md` may be helpful.
Also see [this original announcement](https://notehub.org/w7037) for another
comparison.

Parsec is old and somewhat famous in the Haskell community, so we understand
there will be some kind of inertia, but we advise you use Megaparsec from
now on because it solves many problems of the original Parsec project. If
you think you still have a reason to use original Parsec, open an issue.

### Megaparsec vs Trifecta

[Trifecta](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/trifecta) is another Haskell
library featuring good error messages. It's probably good, but also
under-documented, and has
unfixed [bugs and flaws](https://github.com/ekmett/trifecta/issues) that
Edward is too busy to fix (simply a fact, no offense intended). Other
reasons one may question choice of Trifecta is his/her parsing library:

* Complicated, doesn't have any tutorials available, and documentation
  doesn't help at all.

* Trifecta can parse `String` and `ByteString` natively, but not `Text`.

* Trifecta's error messages may be different with their own features, but
  certainly not as flexible as Megaparsec's error messages in the latest
  versions.

* Depends on `lens`. This means you'll pull in half of Hackage as transitive
  dependencies. Also if you're not into `lens` and would like to keep your
  code “vanilla”, you may not like the API.

### Megaparsec vs Earley

[Earley](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Earley) is a newer library that
allows to safely (it your code compiles, then it probably works) parse
context-free grammars (CFG). Megaparsec is a lower-level library compared to
Earley, but there are still enough reasons to choose it over Earley:

* Megaparsec is faster.

* Your grammar may be not context-free or you may want introduce some sort
  of state to the parsing process. Almost all non-trivial parsers require
  something of this sort. Even if your grammar is context-free, state may
  allow to add some additional niceties. Earley does not support that.

* Megaparsec's error messages are more flexible allowing to include
  arbitrary data in them, return multiple error messages, mark regions that
  affect any error that happens in those regions, etc.

* The approach Earley uses differs from the conventional monadic parsing. If
  you work not alone, people you work with, especially beginners, will be
  much more productive with libraries taking more traditional path to
  parsing like Megaparsec.

IOW, Megaparsec is less safe but also more powerful.

### Megaparsec vs Parsers

There is [Parsers](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsers) package,
which is great. You can use it with Megaparsec or Parsec, but consider the
following:

* It depends on both Attoparsec and Parsec. This is ridiculous, by the way,
  because this package is supposed to be useful for parser builders, so they
  can write basic core functionality and get the rest “for free”.

* It currently has a ~~bug~~ feature in definition of `lookAhead` for
  various monad transformers like `StateT`, etc. which is visible when you
  create backtracking state via monad stack, not via built-in features. The
  feature makes it so `lookAhead` will backtrack your parser state but not
  your custom state added via `StateT`. Kmett thinks this behavior is
  better.

We intended to use Parsers library in Megaparsec at some point, but aside
from already mentioned flaws the library has different conventions for
naming of things, different set of “core” functions, etc., different
approach to lexing. So it didn't happen, Megaparsec has minimal
dependencies, it is feature-rich and self-contained.
