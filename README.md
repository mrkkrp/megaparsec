This is an industrial-strength monadic parser combinator library. Megaparsec
is a fork of [Parsec](https://github.com/aslatter/parsec) library originally
written by Daan Leijen.

## Features

This project provides flexible solutions to satisfy common parsing
needs. The section describes them shortly. If you're looking for
comprehensive documentation, see the
[section about documentation](#documentation).

### Core features

The package is built around `MonadParsec`, a MTL-style monad
transformer. All tools and features work with any instance of
`MonadParsec`. You can achieve various effects combining monad transformers,
i.e. building monad stack. Since most common monad transformers like
`WriterT`, `StateT`, `ReaderT` and others are instances of `MonadParsec`,
you can wrap `ParsecT` *in* these monads, achieving, for example,
backtracking state.

On the other hand `ParsecT` is instance of many type classes as well. The
most useful ones are `Monad`, `Applicative`, `Alternative`, and
`MonadParsec`.

The module
[`Text.Megaparsec.Combinator`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec/docs/Text-Megaparsec-Combinator.html)
(its functions are included in `Text.Megaparsec`) contains traditional,
general combinators that work with any instance of `Alternative` and some
even with instances of `Applicative`.

Role of `Monad`, `Applicative`, and `Alternative` should be obvious, so
let's enumerate methods of `MonadParsec` type class. The class represents
core, basic functions of Megaparsec parsing. The rest of library is built
via combination of these primitives:

* `failure` allows to fail with arbitrary collection of messages.

* `label` allows to add a “label” to any parser, so when it fails the user will
  see the label in the error message where “expected” items are enumerated.

* `hidden` hides any parser from error messages altogether, this is
  officially recommended way to hide things, prefer it to the `label ""`
  approach.

* `try` enables backtracking in parsing.

* `lookAhead` allows to parse something without consuming input.

* `notFollowedBy` succeeds when its argument fails, it does not consume
  input.

* `withRecovery` allows to recover from parse errors “on-the-fly” and
  continue parsing. Once parsing is finished, several parse errors may be
  reported or ignored altogether.

* `observing` allows to “observe” parse errors without ending parsing (they
  are returned in `Left`, while normal results are wrapped in `Right`).

* `eof` only succeeds at the end of input.

* `token` is used to parse single token.

* `tokens` makes it easy to parse several tokens in a row.

* `getParserState` returns full parser state.

* `updateParserState` applies given function on parser state.

This list of core functions is longer than in some other libraries. Our goal
was efficient and readable implementation of functionality provided by every
such primitive, not minimal number of them. You can read the comprehensive
description of every primitive function in
[Megaparsec documentation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec/docs/Text-Megaparsec-Prim.html).

Megaparsec can currently work with the following types of input stream
out-of-box:

* `String` = `[Char]`

* `ByteString` (strict and lazy)

* `Text` (strict and lazy)

### Error messages

Megaparsec 5 introduces well-typed error messages and ability to use custom
data types to adjust the library to your domain of interest. No need to keep
your info as shapeless bunch of strings anymore.

The default error component (`Dec`) has constructors corresponding to `fail`
function and indentation-related error messages. It is a decent option that
should work out-of-box for most parsing needs, while you are free to use
your own custom error component when necessary with little effort.

This new design allowed Megaparsec 5 to have much more helpful error
messages for indentation-sensitive parsing instead of plain “incorrect
indentation” phrase.

### Alex and Happy support

Megaparsec works well with streams of tokens produced by tools like
Alex/Happy. Megaparsec 5 adds `updatePos` method to `Stream` type class that
gives you full control over textual positions that are used to report token
positions in error messages. You can update current position on per
character basis or extract it from token — all cases are covered.

### Character parsing

Megaparsec has decent support for Unicode-aware character parsing. Functions
for character parsing live in [`Text.Megaparsec.Char`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec/docs/Text-Megaparsec-Char.html) (they all are
included in `Text.Megaparsec`). The functions can be divided into several
categories:

* *Simple parsers* — parsers that parse certain character or several
  characters of the same kind. This includes `newline`, `crlf`, `eol`,
  `tab`, and `space`.

* *Parsers corresponding to categories of characters* parse single character
  that belongs to certain category of characters, for example:
  `controlChar`, `spaceChar`, `upperChar`, `lowerChar`, `printChar`,
  `digitChar`, and others.

* *General parsers* that allow you to parse a single character you specify
  or one of given characters, or any character except for given ones, or
  character satisfying given predicate. Case-insensitive versions of the
  parsers are available.

* *Parsers for sequences of characters* parse strings. These are more
  efficient and provide better error messages than other approaches most
  programmers can come up with. Case-sensitive `string` parser is available
  as well as case-insensitive `string'`.

### Permutation parsing

For those who are interested in parsing of permutation phrases, there is
[`Text.Megaparsec.Perm`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec/docs/Text-Megaparsec-Perm.html). You have to import the module explicitly, it's not
included in the `Text.Megaparsec` module.

### Expression parsing

Megaparsec has a solution for parsing of expressions. Take a look at
[`Text.Megaparsec.Expr`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec/docs/Text-Megaparsec-Expr.html). You have to import the module explicitly, it's not
included in the `Text.Megaparsec`.

Given a table of operators that describes their fixity and precedence, you
can construct a parser that will parse any expression involving the
operators. See documentation for comprehensive description of how it works.

### Lexer

[`Text.Megaparsec.Lexer`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec/docs/Text-Megaparsec-Lexer.html)
is a module that should help you write your lexer. If you have used `Parsec`
in the past, this module “fixes” its particularly inflexible
`Text.Parsec.Token`.

`Text.Megaparsec.Lexer` is intended to be imported qualified, it's not
included in `Text.Megaparsec`. The module doesn't impose how you should
write your parser, but certain approaches may be more elegant than
others. An especially important theme is parsing of white space, comments,
and indentation.

The design of the module allows you quickly solve simple tasks and doesn't
get in your way when you want to implement something less standard.

Since Megaparsec 5, all tools for indentation-sensitive parsing are
available in `Text.Megaparsec.Lexer` module — no third party packages
required.

## Documentation

Megaparsec is well-documented. All functions and data-types are thoroughly
described. We pay attention to avoid outdated info or unclear phrases in our
documentation. See the [current version of Megaparsec documentation on
Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec) for yourself.

## Tutorials

You can visit [site of the project](https://mrkkrp.github.io/megaparsec/)
which
has [several tutorials](https://mrkkrp.github.io/megaparsec/tutorials.html)
that should help you to start with your parsing tasks. The site also has
instructions and tips for Parsec users who decide to switch. If you want to
improve an existing tutorial or add your own, open a PR
against [this repo](https://github.com/mrkkrp/megaparsec-site).

## Performance

Despite being quite flexible, Megaparsec is also faster than Parsec. The
repository includes benchmarks that can be easily used to compare Megaparsec
and Parsec. In most cases Megaparsec is faster, sometimes dramatically
faster. If you happen to have some other benchmarks, I would appreciate if
you add Megaparsec to them and let me know how it performs.

If you think your Megaparsec parser is not efficient enough, take a look
at [these instructions](https://mrkkrp.github.io/megaparsec/tutorials/writing-a-fast-parser.html).

## Comparison with other solutions

There are quite a few libraries that can be used for parsing in Haskell,
let's compare Megaparsec with some of them.

### Megaparsec vs Attoparsec

[Attoparsec](https://github.com/bos/attoparsec) is another prominent Haskell
library for parsing. Although the both libraries deal with parsing, it's
usually easy to decide which you will need in particular project:

* *Attoparsec* is much faster but not that feature-rich. It should be used
  when you want to process large amounts of data where performance matters
  more than quality of error messages.

* *Megaparsec* is good for parsing of source code or other human-readable
  texts. It has better error messages and it's implemented as monad
  transformer.

So, if you work with something human-readable where size of input data is
usually not huge, just go with Megaparsec, otherwise Attoparsec may be a
better choice.

### Megaparsec vs Parsec

Since Megaparsec is a fork of Parsec, it's necessary to list main
differences between the two libraries:

* Better error messages. We test our error messages using dense QuickCheck
  tests. Good error messages are just as important for us as correct return
  values of our parsers. Megaparsec will be especially useful if you write
  compiler or interpreter for some language.

* Some quirks and “buggy features” (as well as plain bugs) of original
  Parsec are fixed. There is no undocumented surprising stuff in Megaparsec.

* Better support for Unicode parsing in `Text.Megaparsec.Char`.

* Megaparsec has more powerful combinators and can parse languages where
  indentation matters.

* Comprehensive QuickCheck test suite covering nearly 100% of our code.

* We have benchmarks to detect performance regressions.

* Better documentation, with 100% of functions covered, without typos and
  obsolete information, with working examples. Megaparsec's documentation is
  well-structured and doesn't contain things useless to end users.

* Megaparsec's code is clearer and doesn't contain “magic” found in original
  Parsec.

* Megaparsec has well-typed error messages and custom error messages.

* Megaparsec can recover from parse errors “on the fly” and continue
  parsing.

* Megaparsec is faster.

* Megaparsec is better supported.

If you want to see a detailed change log, `CHANGELOG.md` may be helpful.
Also see [this original announcement](https://notehub.org/w7037) for another
comparison.

To be honest Parsec's development has seemingly stagnated. It has no test
suite (only three per-bug tests), and all its releases beginning from
version 3.1.2 (according or its change log) were about introducing and
fixing regressions. Parsec is old and somewhat famous in Haskell community,
so we understand there will be some kind of inertia, but we advise you use
Megaparsec from now on because it solves many problems of original Parsec
project. If you think you still have a reason to use original Parsec, open
an issue.

### Megaparsec vs Trifecta

[Trifecta](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/trifecta) is another Haskell
library featuring good error messages. Like some other projects of Edward
Kmett, it's probably good, but also poorly documented, arcane, and has
unfixed [bugs and flaws](https://github.com/ekmett/trifecta/issues) that
Edward is too busy to fix (simply a fact, no offense intended). Other
reasons one may question choice of Trifecta is his/her parsing library:

* Complicated, doesn't have any tutorials available, and documentation
  doesn't help at all.

* Trifecta can parse `String` and `ByteString` natively, but not `Text`.

* Trifecta's error messages may be different with their own features, but
  certainly not as flexible as Megaparsec's error messages in the latest
  versions.

* Depends on `lens`. This means you'll pull in half of Hackage as transitive
  dependencies. Also if you're not into `lens` and would like to keep your
  code “vanilla”, you may not like the API.

### Megaparsec vs Earley

[Earley](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Earley) is a newer library that
allows to safely (it your code compiles, then it probably works) parse
context-free grammars (CFG). Megaparsec is a lower-level library compared to
Earley, but there are still enough reasons to choose it over Earley:

* Megaparsec is faster.

* Your grammar may be not context free or you may want introduce some sort
  of state to the parsing process. Almost all non-trivial parsers require
  something of this sort. Even if your grammar is context-free, state may
  allow to add some additional niceties. Earley does not support that.

* Megaparsec's error messages are more flexible allowing to include
  arbitrary data in them, return multiple error messages, mark regions that
  affect any error that happens in those regions, etc.

* The approach Earley uses differs from conventional monadic parsing. If you
  work not alone, chances people you work with, especially beginners will be
  much more productive with libraries taking more traditional path to
  parsing like Megaparsec.

IOW, Megaparsec is less safe but also much more powerful.

### Megaparsec vs Parsers

There is [Parsers](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsers) package,
which is great. You can use it with Megaparsec or Parsec, but consider the
following:

* It depends on Attoparsec, Parsec, and Trifecta, which means you always
  grab half of Hackage as transitive dependencies by using it. This is
  ridiculous, by the way, because this package is supposed to be useful for
  parser builders, so they can write basic core functionality and get the
  rest “for free”.

* It currently has a bug in definition of `lookAhead` for various monad
  transformers like `StateT`, etc. which is visible when you create
  backtracking state via monad stack, not via built-in features.

We intended to use Parsers library in Megaparsec at some point, but aside
from already mentioned flaws the library has different conventions for
naming of things, different set of “core” functions, etc., different
approach to lexer. So it didn't happen, Megaparsec has minimal dependencies,
it is feature-rich and self-contained.
