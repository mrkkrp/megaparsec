# Megaparsec tests

Megaparsec's test suite as a standalone package. The reason for separtion is
that we can avoid circular dependency on `hspec-megaparsec` and thus avoid
keeping copies of its source files in our test suite, as we had to do
before. Another benefit is that we can export some auxiliary functions in
`megaparsec-tests` which can be used by other test suites, for example in
the `parser-combinators-tests` package.

Version of `megaparsec-tests` will be kept in sync with versions of
`megaparsec` from now on.
